<h1>Common Lisp AES encryption</h1>
I have made two implementations of AES
<ul>
  <li> <a href = "aes32.lisp">aes32.lisp</a> is
  optimized for CLs that handle 32 bits arithmetic, such as CMUCL.<br>
  A program to make NIST test vectors is
  <a href = "aes-nist.lisp">aes-nits.lisp</a>.

  <li> <a href = "aes8.lisp">aes8.lisp</a>
  is based on the reference implementation and uses 8 bits arithmetic. <br>
  The performance is slow but less varying among
  Common Lisp implementations.
</ul>

Another AES Common Lisp implementation is made by 
<a href="http://www.cs.rice.edu/~froydnj/">
Nathan Froyd</a><br>
(who is probably using the same web-designer as I do)
