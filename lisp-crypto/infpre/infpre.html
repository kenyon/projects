<h1>Infpre - A Common Lisp infix utility</h1>
<a href = "infpre.lisp">Infpre</a> is a prefix <-> infix conversion tool 
for Common Lisp. The intended use is for CL programs with long math formulas.
<br>
The package infpre contains:
<ul>
  <li> infix->prefix - function 
  <li> prefix->infix - function
  <li> math - macro
  <li> !! - macro 
</ul>
 

<h2> How does the infix->prefix function work? </h2>
infix->prefix takes two list arguments:
the expression and the operators. The expression
is just an ordinary lisp list and the operators are math symbols like + and *,
where list order gives presedence.
An important point is that the operators are <em>not binary</em>, 
but list separators (like comma),
i.e. 1 + 2 + ... is a + separated list.

<br>
Example:
<pre> 
% (infix->prefix '(1 + 2 * 3 + 4) '(+ *))
(+ 1 (* 2 3) 4)
</pre>

<h2> How does the prefix->infix function work? </h2>
Hopefully as expected.

<h2>How does the math macro work?</h2>
Works as defun, but with infix math. If name is _ then
it works as lambda.
<br>
Example:
<pre>
% (math f (x) 
    (let ((a 0.1))
      (exp (-1 * a * expt x 2))))
F
% (f 2)
0.67032003
</pre>

<h2>How does the !! macro work?</h2>
It simply applies infix->prefix with standard math operators.
Since there are no read macroes there 
must be spaces between the operators.
<pre>
(!! (let ((a 42)) a - 2 * 2 * 10))
2
</pre>
